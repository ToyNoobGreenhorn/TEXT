    "I think you should quote the line .  I dont think thats what the line said .  The only thing I would say here is that you didnt email me .  What happened is that this piece published out .  I tweeted it out .  You tweeted a public challenge to me to come on your show .  Your producer emailed me to come on your show .  I emailed your producer and said ,  \"Hey can you connect me to Sam ?  We should talk about this . \" Then our emails began .  Which is not a big deal I just want to note that .  All right ,  well ,  I appreciate that summary . Obviously ,  and Im sure well get into this stuff ,  I have disagreements with which articles are fair and which arent ,  but I dont think that that is where I want to begin this .  Im sure well go through that .  And people can read the original Vox articles - theyll all be linked in my show notes ,  I assume ,  Sam ,  theyll be linked in yours - they can read our emails to each other .  They can read my article .  They can listen to the original podcast .  If you would like to be a Sam Harris and Ezra Klein completist ,  the option is very much there . I listened to your housekeeping episode the other day ,  so I think I have some sense ,  Sam ,  of where you are coming into this ,  and I want to give you a sense of where I am in the hopes that it will be productive .  Something youve said over and over and over again to me at this point is that to you ,  from the beginning ,  Ive been here in bad faith .  The problem is that Ive come to this ,  coming to slander you ,  to destroy your reputation ,  to silence you .  And I really take that as a signal failure on my part .  I have not been able to persuade you ,  and maybe I will be today ,  that I really disagree with you strongly - I think some of the things youre trafficking in are not just wrong ,  but theyre harmful - but I do so in good faith . Im here because I want to persuade you .  One of the tricky things here is that I was not that involved in the original Vox article ,  I was editor-in-chief at the time ,  but I didnt assign or edit it .  I stand by it - things you publish when youre editor-in-chief ultimately are on you - and I actually think its a good piece .  But there are times when I can only speak from my perspective ,  not from the perspective of other people who wrote other things . But the way I read the conversation you had with Murray ,  and I think you gesture at this in your opening here ,  you begin that conversation by really framing it around your shared experience responding to politically correct criticism . You say ,  and Im quoting you here ,  \"in the intervening years , \" - so the intervening years since Murray published The Bell Curve - \"I ventured into my own controversial areas as a speaker and writer .  I experienced many hysterical attacks against me and my work .  I started thinking about your case\" - your case being Murrays case - \"a little again ,  without ever having read you ,  and I began to suspect that you were one of the canaries in the coal mine that I never recognized as such . \"So you say explicitly in the opening to that podcast ,  that in the treatment of Murray ,  you saw the seeds of later treatment of you .  Ive spent a lot of time thinking about this ,  because something that Ive been trying to do here is see this from your perspective . Here is my view: I think you have a deep empathy for Charles Murrays side of this conversation ,  because you see yourself in it .  I dont think you have as deep an empathy for the other side of this conversation .  For the people being told once again that they are genetically and environmentally and at any rate immutably less intelligent and that our social policy should reflect that .  I think part of the absence of that empathy is it doesnt threaten you .  I dont think you see a threat to you in that ,  in the way you see a threat to you in whats happened to Murray .  In some cases ,  Im not even quite sure you heard what Murray was saying on social policy either in The Bell Curve and a lot of his later work ,  or on the podcast .  I think that led to a blind spot ,  and this is worth discussing . I like your podcast .  I think you have a big platform and a big audience .  I think its bad for the world if Murrays take on this gets recast here as political bravery ,  or impartial ,  or non-controversial .  What I want to do here ,  its not really convince you that Im right .  I dont think Im going to do that .  Its not to convince you to like me ,  I dont think Im going to do that either ,  I get that . What I want to convince you of is that theres a side of this you should become more curious about .  You should be doing shows with people like Ibram Kendi ,  who is the author of Stamped from the Beginning ,  which is a book on racist ideas in America which won the National Book Award a couple of years back .  People who really study how race and these ideas interact with American life and policy . I think the fact that we are two white guys talking about how growing up nonwhite in America affects your life and cognitive development is a problem here ,  just as it was a problem in the Murray conversation .  And I want to persuade you that that some of the things that the so-called social justice warriors are worried about ,  are worth worrying about ,  and that the excesses of activists ,  while real and problematic ,  theyre not as a big deal as the things theyre really trying to fight and to draw attention to .  Maybe Ill take a breath there and let you in .  This is good ,  because I think this gets much closer to the meat of where we actually disagree .  Something I want to be clear about is what I think was wrong in that podcast is not that you didnt virtue signal .  Its not that you didnt come out and say ,  \"Hey ,  listen ,  just before I start this up ,  I want everybody to know Im not a racist . \"And by the way Im not here to say youre racist ,  I dont think you are .  We have not called you one .  I actually think we should talk later about literally just what racism is ,  how we use that word in this conversation . But my criticism of your podcast and ,  by the way my criticism also of Murray ,  and this is useful ,  because I can work backwards through your answer here ,  is not that you didnt excuse yourself .  Its that in a conversation about an outcome of American life - How do African Americans and whites score on IQ tests in America today ?  What happens when somebody sits down and takes the test today ?  - that is an outcome of the American experiment ,  an experiment weve been running in this country for hundreds of years .  You did not discuss how race and racism act upon that outcome .  You did not discuss it . I mean ,  amazingly to me ,  you all didnt talk about slavery or segregation once .  What Im saying here is not that you lack empathy - although in a different space ,  I think you have a sense of what Murray is going through that is different from your sense of what other people who are hurt in this conversation go through ,  I do believe that - but as it comes to the way you actually conducted the conversation ,  Im arguing that you lacked a sense of history ,  that you didnt deal in a serious way with the history of this conversation ,  a conversation that has been going on literally since the dawn of the country .  A conversation that has been wrong in virtually every version ,  in every iteration ,  weve had in America before . The other thing I want to say about this ,  and this gets very importantly to Charles Murrays work .  Youre a neuroscientist .  And so I get that you look at Murray and you look at The Bell Curve and what you see are the tables and the appendices and the scientific version of Charles Murray . Im a policy journalist .  My background is I live in Washington ,  DC ,  I cover politics .  Charles Murray - not just to me ,  what he literally is - is what we call a policy entrepreneur .  Hes somebody who his entire career has been spent at Washington think tanks .  Hes at the American Enterprise Institute ,  where I have a lot of friends ,  and I respect that organization quite a bit .  He argues in different ways and throughout his entire body of work for policy outcomes . His book before The Bell Curve is called Losing Ground .  Its a book about why we should dissolve the Great Society programs .  By the way ,  when he was selling that book ,  he said ,  \"a lot of whites think theyre racist ,  and this is a book that tells them they arent . \"Then he came out with The Bell Curve and well go through this .  Ill quote this back to you ,  but in The Bell Curves final chapter ,  he says ,  Why did I do any of this ?  Why did I talk about any of this ?  Him and Richard Herrnstein ,  obviously the co-author of that book .  He says ,  The reason I did it is because we in America need to re-embrace a politics of difference .  We need to understand that we are cognitively different from each other ,  not just by race ,  but other folks too ,  but by race as well ,  and that understanding that changes what we should do in social policy . He literally says ,  and again I can quote this to you if youd like ,  he says ,  for one thing ,  we have all these low cognitive capacity women giving birth ,  and by having the social supports for poor children in this country ,  we are subsidizing them to give birth .  What we need to do is take those subsidies away .  These women ,  who according to his book are disproportionately African American ,  their poor children should not get as much federal support when they are born ,  so they are disincentivized to have as many children . He also says that we have all these folks who are Hispanic coming up over the border ,  that our immigration policy is letting in too many low-IQ people .  While hes not quite as prescriptive in that part ,  hes pretty clear that he wants us to change our immigration policy ,  in order to resist dysgenic pressure . The other thing you brought up his UBI work .  The reason I bring this up is that ,  the reason Charles Murrays work is problematic ,  is that he uses these arguments about IQ - and a lot of other arguments he makes about other things - to push these points into the public debate ,  where he is very ,  very ,  very influential .  Hes not by any means a silenced actor in Washington .  He gives Congressional testimony .  He won the Bradley Prize in 2016 and got a $250 , 000 check for it .  His book on UBI ,  it is completely of a piece with this .  I reviewed that book when it came out .  Its an interesting book ,  people should read it ,  but it is a way of cutting social spending .  According to Murrays own numbers ,  he says it would cut social spending by a trillion dollars in 2020 .  To give you a sense of scale ,  Obamacare costs two trillion dollars over 10 years . This is another book in a different way that is a huge argument for cutting social spending ,  which in part he justifies by saying ,  we are trying to redress racial inequality based on an idea that it is a product of American history ,  when in fact it is some combination of innate and environmental ,  but at any rate ,  it is not something were going to be able to change ,  and so we should stop trying ,  or at least stop trying in the way we have been .  When I hear this .  I actually really wonder how much  .  .  .  I want to be careful here .  I know Charles Murray .  When I wrote my very first piece as a journalist in Washington ,  it was a piece about poverty ,  I interviewed him for it .  Ive reviewed his books .  Ive talked with him .  My wife is writing a book about UBI actually .  Hes quoted in the book .  I do not want Charles Murray silenced ,  and hes a lovely guy interpersonally .  Theres no doubt about that .  The quote you read from him about luck ,  I want to put a pin in that ,  because theres a whole conversation I want to have with you about that quote .  If Charles Murray followed what that quote implies ,  I think things would look very different with him and with my view of his career . But I do think I need to go through some of what you said here .  First ,  I dont know how much you understand Charles Murrays career .  As I said ,  his first book is Losing Ground .  Its a book about the Great Society .  Its a book - Sam ,  Ive let you had your say .  Im just going to - Dont worry .  Were going to go through all this ,  and I dont mean this to be sharp ,  but you dont give short answers yourself .  Were just going to have to indulge the other one here . His first book is Losing Ground .  Its about dissolving the welfare state .  Again ,  he says about that book ,  a lot of whites think theyre racists ,  Im going to show them theyre not . The next book is The Bell Curve .  The way Murray often defends The Bell Curve is by saying ,  \"Hey ,  look it only had this one chapter on race and IQ . \" Hes completely ,  or actually a couple of chapters ,  but hes completely right about that .  The chapters where that is mentioned ,  they are not the bulk of the book . But Im actually a publisher of pieces .  I work with a lot of authors on book excerpts .  The furor around The Bell Curve is not around the book ,  which its a long book ,  most people havent read it .  Its that the part of the book that he had excerpted on the cover of the New Republic under Andrew Sullivan - the cover of the New Republic ,  it just says in big letters ,  \"Race and IQ . \" The reason that is the part people focus on is that they pulled the most controversial part of the book and made it a huge deal .  I know that authors ,  when they dont want their most controversial part to define the work ,  they dont let you excerpt that .  So one ,  I dont think Murrays blameless there . His next book is honestly weirder .  I dont know if youve read ,  or even got familiar with Human Achievement ,  the next book ?  So Human Achievement is a book where Murray ,  and this comes right after The Bell Curve - and when I describe this book I almost feel like people are not going to believe me ,  but go look it up - Murray wants to quantify the human achievements of different races .  The way he does that is he looks in a bunch of encyclopedias and he literally counts up the amount of space given to the accomplishments of artists and philosophers and scientists from different places .  He uses that to say white Europeans have done the most to push forward human achievement .  One criticism that I and other people have of Murray is that he often looks at indicators that reflect inequality and uses them to justify inequality .  That book is one of the most massive correlation-causation errors I can possibly imagine . So now the next thing you said is that in doing this that Im conflating two things .  Im conflating just a calm discussion you two ha about the science with the social policy agenda .  I want to read you actually what was said in your discussion with Murray about this ,  because this is actually why Im interested in it . When you were talking with Murray ,  one thing - I think to your credit - is you repeatedly asked him ,  why do this at all ?  Why have this whole discussion about race and IQ ?  What are we doing here ? You say ,  \"Why seek data on racial differences at all ?  What is the purpose of doing this ? \" Murray responds ,  and ,  again ,  Im quoting:Because we now have social policy embedded in employment policy ,  in academic policy ,  which is based on the premise that everybody is equal above the neck ,  whether it is men ,  or women ,  or whether it is ethnicities .  When you have that embedded that into law ,  you have a variety of bad things happen . Then you ask it again .  You say ,  \"Needless to say ,  Im sure we can find hate supremacist organizations who love the fact that The Bell Curve was published and admonish their remembers to read it at the first opportunity .  Why look at this ?  How does this help society get more information about racial difference ? \"Murray ,  again ,  Im not going to read the whole thing ,  because I think that would be dull ,  gives a long answer about affirmative action and why it is bad .  So ,  I am not the one conflating this ,  number one .  I am listening to the conversation you had .  Im listening to the conversation you had ,  Im a close reader of Murrays work ,  and the reason I care about this stuff is I care about what the actual social policy outcomes are .  The final thing - You can respond to everything when Im done ,  I promise .  I will shut up and let you talk .  The final thing that you did in your answer to me here ,  what you said again and again ,  is people \"pretending\" to believe politically correct ideas .  People pretending to believe bad evidence . A couple things on that .  I dont doubt your sincerity in this ,  but I can assure you that Nisbett and Paige Harden and Eric Turkheimer and me ,  we actually believe what we believe .  One of the things that has honestly been frustrating to me in dealing with you is you have a very sensitive ear to where you feel that somebody has insulted to you ,  but not a sensitive ear to yourself .  During this discussion ,  you have called me ,  and not through implication ,  not through something where youre reading in between the lines ,  youve called me a slanderer ,  a liar ,  intellectually dishonest ,  a bad-faith actor ,  cynically motivated by profit ,  defamatory ,  a libelist .  Youve called Turkheimer and Nisbett and Paige Harden ,  youve called them fringe .  Youve said just here that theyre part of a politically correct moral panic . I do think that you need to do a little bit more here to credit the idea that there just is a disagreement here .  Its a disagreement in part because people are looking at different parts of this with different emphasis ,  but also a disagreement because people look at this issue and see different things .  I often hear you on your podcast talk about how its important to try to extend the idea of the sincerity .  One thing Ive not done is assume that you dont believe what you believe .  Everybody here is trying to have an argument about something that is important ,  that in Murrays words should feed into how we order society ,  what we do to redress racial difference .  Thats not just a high stakes conversation .  Its also one where people just disagree .  There is so much there . I actually really appreciate that answer ,  because I think it helps open this up .  So let me say a couple things here . One of the things Ive come to think about you that I actually did not come into this believing is ,  youre very quick to see a lot of psychological tendencies ,  cognitive fallacies ,  etc .  in others that you dont see applying to yourself ,  or people youve written into your tribe .  You say words in there like confirmation bias ,  etc .  ,  to me about how were looking at Murray .  The whole thing I just told you is that Charles Murray is a guy who works at conservative think tanks ,  whose first book was about why we should get rid of the welfare state ,  who is ,  his whole lifes work is about breaking down social policy . To the extent that I have any biases that flow backwards from political commitments ,  so does he .  Were all - Hold on Sam .  Im going to go through this .  I promise you I will get to your bias very quickly . I do want you to know ,  you mentioned James Flynn here .  To prepare for this conversation ,  I called Flynn the other day .  I spoke to him on Monday .  His read of the evidence right now ,  and this is me quoting him .  He says ,  \"I think it is more probably than not that the IQ difference between black and white Americans is environmental .  As a social scientist ,  I cannot be sure if they have a genetic advantage or disadvantage . \" That is what James Flynn thinks of Monday . Then you asked me - and I think this is a good question ,  because I think this gets to the core of this and it gets to where I tried to open us up into - your view of this debate is that to say that you have a bias in it is to say ,  in your terms ,  that youre like the grand dragon of the KKK .  That the only version of a bias that can be influencing what you see here is a core form of racism .  Thats actually not my view of you ,  but I do think you have a bias . I think you have a huge sensitivity ,  lets put it that way ,  and you have a lot of difficulty extending an assumption of good faith to anyone who disagrees with you on an issue that you code as identity politics .  Theres a place actually where I think you got into this in a pretty interesting way .  I went back and I read your discussion with Glenn Loury . At the beginning ,  when youre talking about why you chose to have Glenn on the show ,  you say ,  \"My goal was to find an African American intellectual ,  who could really get into the details with me ,  but whom I also trusted to have a truly rationale conversation that wouldnt be contaminated by identity politics . \" To you ,  engaging in identity politics discredits your ability to participate in a rational conversation ,  and its something ,  as far as I can tell ,  that you do not see yourself as doing . So heres my question for you: On that specific quote ,  what does it mean to you ,  particularly when youre talking about something like race ,  to have your ideas contaminated by identity politics ?  Thats super helpful .  Heres my criticism of you .  I dont think you realize that the identity politics software is operating in you all the time and ,  I think its strong . When you look at literature on the conversation about race in America ,  you often see the discussion broken into racists and anti-racists .  Thats something that youll read often in this debate .  I think theres something else ,  particularly lately ,  which you might call anti-anti-racism ,  which is folks who are fundamentally more concerned ,  or fundamentally primarily concerned ,  with the overreach of what you would call the anti-racists .  And ,  actually thats where I think you are . One of the things that I hear in you is that ,  whenever something gets near the questions of political correctness - the canary and the coal mine for the way you yourself have been treated - you get very ,  very ,  very strident .  Theyre in bad faith .  Theyre not being able to speak rationally .  Theyre not being able to have a conversation that is actually going forward on a sound evidentiary basis .  The thing that I dont think that youre self-reflective enough about - and I apologize ,  because I know that \"I\" statements are better than \"you\" statements ,  but I do want to push this idea at you for you to think about it - is that there are things that are threats to you .  There are things that are threats to your tribe ,  to your future ,  to your career ,  and those threats are very salient . You see what happens with Charles Murray ,  the kind of criticism he gets ,  and that sets off every alarm bell in your head .  You bring him on the show and youre like ,  \"Were going to fix this .  Im going to show that they cant do this to you . \" You look around and you say ,  \"Ezra ,  you think we shouldnt take away all efforts to redress racial inequality ?  But thats a bias .  Youre just being led around by your political opinions ,  where I am standing outside the debate acting rationally . \"To me thats actually not whats happening at all .  I think youre missing a lot ,  because you are very radically increasing the salience of things that threaten your identity ,  your tribe - which is not the craziest thing to do in the world ,  ts not a terrible thing to do ,  we all do it - without admitting ,  or maybe even without realizing ,  thats what youre doing . I think that there is a lot of discussion like this in the public sphere just generally at the moment .  There are a lot of white commentators ,  of which I am also one ,  who look at whats happening on some campuses ,  or look at what happens on Twitter mobs ,  or whatever ,  and they see a threat to them .  The concern about political correctness goes way ,  way ,  way ,  way up .  Then the ability to hear what the folks who are making the arguments actually say dissolves .  The ability to hear what the so-called social justice warriors are actually worried about dissolves .  I think thats a really big blind spot here .  I think its making it hard for you to see when people have a good faith disagreement with you ,  and I also think its making harder for you to see how to weight some of the different concerns that are operating in this conversation . Youre so concerned about Murray and what has happened here ,  when again ,  hes an extremely successful scholar in Washington .  I mean ,  in your whole show ,  Sam ,  youve had 120-some episodes ,  and - I could have miscounted this ,  I totally take that as a possibility here - but youve had two - I think youve had two African Americans as guests .  I think you need to explore the experience of race in American more and not just see that as identity politics .  See that as information that is important to talking about some of things you want to talk about ,  but also to hearing from some of the people who youve now written out of the conversation to hear .  Im shocked! Intellectual inferiority .  Two things here .  One ,  when I talk about what Murray says specifically I do use intellectual inferiority .  I got the piece out in front of me . I do think ,  100 percent ,  without doubt ,  that when we have ,  in American life ,  over and over and over again ,  said that African Americans are intellectually less capable than whites ,  that has been - yes ,  that is a way of saying that they are inferior and it has been a way of treating them as if they are inferior .  It is been a way of justifying social outcomes that are unbelievably unequal and unfair that have been going on until ,  I mean ,  theyre going on in the present day . You know ,  something that you said in here ,  Sam ,  I think is important ,  because ,  while you called it confusion ,  I still am not clear on which part is actually confused . What I would argue about this is recognizing that there are folks who it is easier for us to hear from and harder is part of gathering the information about the world for us to understand what is true .  During our email exchange ,  let me use this as an example .  You wrote to me ,  again quoting here ,  \"If James Flynn is right ,  if Flynn is right ,  than the mean IQs of African-American children ,  who are second- and third-generation upper middle class ,  should have converged with those of the children of upper middle class whites .  But as far as I understand they havent . \"I think that sentence right there ,  that is not having enough experience ,  or having thought hard enough ,  or dug into the literature .  I mean ,  there are different ways of learning about the world ,  of course ,  but about people whos experience is different than yours . I mean ,  Ill give one example that I actually said to you in these emails .  African American families making $100 , 000 a year tend to live in neighborhoods with the same income composition as white families making $30 , 000 a year .  To say that you have an African-American family that is middle class or upper middle class and that their experience is now so similar to that of whites that somehow the environmental atmosphere around them has equalized ,  I think that is something that is being missed and that ,  the way you- Ill just finish on this point .  The way you leverage identity politics here is a way of not forcing yourself to see some of that .  A couple things here . One ,  I just want to call out that you keep doing this thing where you say ,  \"There all these people who disagree with me ,  and they disagree me because theyre not willing to read the data with integrity . \" I am not telling you youre not reading the data with integrity .  You keep telling others that and I think - The scientists ,  Nisbett and Paige Harden and Turkheimer ,  said that they believe Murrays interpretation of this ,  ultimately ,  is pseudoscience and is way ,  way ,  way out in front of the data .  I I spoke with him yesterday .  He holds all the same views on this ,  but that he feels that that wasnt helpful to the debate ,  which is nice of him .  He may be ,  you know ,  its good to keep the debates temperature down ,  but that doesnt change his view .  I think youre going to have to ask Turkheimer what he thinks on this .  I think youre misreading him .  At any rate ,  I think it would be not useful for us to spend our time on that . David Reich ,  in the very article that you sent to me ,  his view on this is that whatever we think now is going to be proven wrong ,  that whatever confidence we have now ,  is going to be shown to be incorrect .  The ideas and the information coming down the pike are going to surprise us .  So ,  the argument of Turkheimer ,  Paige Harden ,  Nisbett ,  in the piece that ,  again ,  people should go to the show notes and read these pieces ,  is that ,  who knows ?  Maybe some time in the future well find this ,  but right now theres no reason to believe it .  That there is a negative IQ difference that is in part genetic for African Americans .  That is the \"it . \" Now one thing that you say I say is that I keep saying Murray calls this genetic .  He does ,  hes pretty clear theres a genetic component .  So you are in the piece .  I can quote it back ,  but its completely true that he says ,  I dont know what the numbers are . What is interesting about the move Murray makes ,  and this is the thing that I call out in my piece and have talked about a bit ,  is that what Murray is intent on showing is that genetic or environmental ,  it cant be changed ,  its immutable . He says ,  \"There is this notion\" - this was in your podcast - \"there is this notion that if traits were genetically determined thats bad and if theyre environmentally determined thats good ,  because we can do something about them if theyre environmental .  If theres one lesson that weve learned from the last 70 years of social policy ,  it is that changing environments in ways that produce measurable results is really ,  really hard .  We actually dont know how to do it ,  no matter how much money we spend . \"If you go read both the original and the second Vox pieces ,  they are primarily about this claim .  They are primarily about the claim that we cannot change these outcomes .  They are primarily about the claim that if you move people into adoption into high-income families ,  they have a 12 to 18 point IQ change .  There is tons and tons of evidence - now were getting into my world again - in the realm of social policy ,  of not just effects from social policy on one generation ,  but multi-generational effects from things like Medicaid and so on . One place where I think this is important is that ,  a lot of the debate here and the reason people care about it ,  is that if youre saying things are immutable ,  often people say theyre immutable because theyre genetic .  Murray actually says theyre immutable really no matter what . If you say theyre immutable ,  thats actually a way - and this is what Murray does ,  again explicitly and repeatedly both on your show and in other places - is say that because theyre immutable ,  that really means that this is not on us .  This is not on us ,  white America ,  or America broadly ,  and we dont have to kind feel so bad .  We can embrace the politics of difference .  We can begin removing some of these social supports .  Dont need to have as much affirmative action .  Dont need this employment nondiscrimination stuff .  We can cut the size of the social welfare state . He wants to do things that stop pushing people up as much and then ,  of course ,  and this is where this has always gone in American history ,  then when people dont advance ,  folks will look at that and say ,  \"Hey look ,  theyre not advancing .  Theyre not closing the gap quickly enough .  That just goes to show the problem is innate . \"This is something you brought up earlier when you brought up that quote from Murray about luck ,  and I think its an important conversation .  I think that if you follow Murrayism on this ,  if you were doing it without the political commitments he brings to it ,  it actually takes you to a very radical and interesting place . If you say that our IQ is genetic and environmental ,  but at any rate ,  its not our fault ,  because we dont choose either one of those ,  and theres not much we can do about it .  Not just our IQ ,  but something youve said is that ,  you know ,  a lot of traits come down like this - the big five personality traits ,  determination .  Look ,  you can connect genetic inheritance to divorce .  I think its a  . 2 or  . 4 correlation .  So ,  if you begin to believe that ,  actually you begin to ask the question of ,  should ,  do we deserve what we have ? Should society be vastly more redistributed than it actually is ?  Should we be much less within this construct that what were getting ,  were getting because of hard work and determination and intelligence and the application of our talents ?  In fact ,  we need to move to something that is ,  Im not literally advocating this ,  but more in the range of full socialism . What I think is so interesting about the way he takes this debate - and I recognize this is not somewhere you took the debate ,  but I do think this is a useful thing to talk about - is that if you really did believe things immutable ,  if you really did believe that this was our inheritance both environmental and genetic and we cant do much about it ,  then I think the implications of that are radical ,  and the implications arent that you take away help from people .  Its that you say pretty much what all of us has is primarily illegitimate .  We didnt do anything to earn it .  I just happened to be born with the collection of talents that got me where I am .  And as such ,  what we should spread around in society is much more vast . Funnily enough ,  I dont ever see people take that attitude on this .  Again ,  the history of these ideas in America is they tend to be used to justify the status quo ,  not radically more generous versions of the status quo ,  but I do think thats interesting ,  and I dont understand why people dont take that leap .  I think that the implication of this is ,  its luck ,  and if you want to believe that - and ,  again ,  I dont believe theyre immutable ,  I dont think thats what the evidence shows - but if you do believe theyre luck ,  I dont think it takes you where he went in your conversation .  Do you want a quick answer on why we didnt publish Haier ?  During this ,  and people heard your explanation at the beginning ,  but we publish a Vox piece .  The Vox authors were getting a lot of criticism from you and others ,  which is reasonable ,  its a debate .  During this ,  you were emailing me and you publicly challenged me to a debate . Theres no guaranteed response from somebodys handpicked expert and I mean ,  thats not how the New York Times op-ed page works or the Washington Post .  But ,  its a reasonable ask to make .  If you had come to me and you had said ,  \"Hey look I dont think this piece was fair to me .  I think this guy Haier wants to write something ,  take a look at it . \" I might have open to that ,  but what you did was you came to me and you said ,  \"Lets debate . \"I had agreed to do it ,  and not only that ,  Id agreed to release the debate to Vox .  So people were going to hear you defend your position .  Now you were backing off of that and demanding instead that I publish a handpicked expert ,  and thats just not the way this works .  Well ,  somebody you preferred who had your views .  I thought that I was giving you the opportunity to respond that you wanted ,  and now you were privately trying to pull that back and do something different .  That to me was just actually bad faith ,  for the record .  Sam ,  you said already ,  in this answer ,  that the thing you cant do and this discussion just slime peoples motivation .  I would say ,  and again ,  I really urge people to go read these pieces .  Nobody tried to slime your motivations .  They said you were wrong ,  and they actually said this is really wrong .  Its dangerous .  They did say something actually about that .  Something you brought up a couple times is something I wrote in my piece ,  and I am actually very happy to talk about this .  I say that the belief that African-Americans are genetically less intelligent than whites ,  and then also inferior in other ways ,  which Im not saying you guys said ,  is our oldest ,  most ancient justification for racial inequality and bigotry .  Do you disagree with that ?  When you look at American history ,  when you look at what we said at the dawn of this country and all the way through the 1950 ,  the 60s ,  when I say that ,  am I wrong ?  One of the things I detect in this conversation ,  this maybe gets to something we discussed that we would talk about later and maybe weve hit that point .  Something I detect here is the idea that ,  and I want to think about how to phrase this carefully ,  because I want to do it without making you defensive ,  is that ideas can only fit into this lineage if they are being said with racial animus ,  if they are being said by someone who doesnt like the people theyre talking about . I think an important thing when we study the history of racism in this country is that it has always had a scientific wrapper .  It has always been not something people thought they were doing because they were hateful ,  it was something they thought they were doing ,  because it was true . I quoted in my piece Thomas Jefferson ,  who ,  brilliant man ,  like a brilliant genteel man - Not just a slaveholder but a particularly vicious one .  But one of the reasons I quoted him is that the end of The Bell Curve ,  one thing Murray does is endorse the idea that a correct understanding of stratified cognitive capacity ,  which operates racially and in other ways ,  should make us re-embrace what he calls a Jeffersonian politics of difference . He quotes Jefferson talking about how important it is to understand that people in society are fit for different uses ,  theyre fit for different places .  I think now we look back at Jefferson and say ,  \"Thats ridiculous the way youre talking about it .  It is grotesque . \"But when Jefferson was doing it ,  he felt himself being genteel when he was saying that African Americans cannot compose thoughts above the level of plain narration .  We now look at that and say ,  in the country that created James Baldwin ,  you think that ?  But Murray - and Im not accusing of holding Jefferson views on race ,  he clearly doesnt - but he then ,  in a very different way ,  comes out and says ,  \"Look ,  we just need to accept that people are different ,  as Thomas Jefferson taught us . \" I doubt that we have ,  given the experiment we have run in this country ,  given the centuries of slavery and segregation and oppression ,  given locking people out of jobs ,  out of good schools ,  out of building wealth ,  out of going into top professions ,  out of being part of the social networks that help you advance; the amount of violence and terror and trauma that we have inflicted on African Americans in this country ,  I absolutely doubt - I truly ,  to the core of my being ,  doubt - that we are at a place where any of us should have confidence saying that the differences we see in individuals now reflect intrinsic group capacity .  I think that at every other point in America history where we have said that - That is exactly what Murray says .  That at every other point in American history .  There is not confusion .  Youll sort it out .  Of course .  At every point in American history where we have made that argument ,  we now look back - and ,  I mean ,  this is not going way back .  Segregation ,  my mom was alive in segregation .  Charles Murray was alive during segregation .  Were talking ,  I think ,  its within the week of the 50th anniversary of Martin Luther Kings assassination .  This is not ancient history ,  it is recent history . I think we look back and say ,  \"Man ,  they really had it wrong . \" You quoted back at me something that I think either I say it ,  or the Vox authors say it ,  now I dont remember ,  but that ,  yeah ,  if youre having a version of this conversation again ,  then it is incumbent on you to say why youre so sure it will be different this time . Murray does say he thinks that some combination of genetic and basically immutably environmental characteristics make it so we cant do much about this and there just are big differences between the groups ,  and its just going to remain that way ,  and American politics need to rearrange itself around that reality . Yeah ,  I strongly disagree ,  and I disagree because of American history .  That is why my fundamental criticism of that conversation was that you needed to deal more with the history of this conversation and the history of this country .  No ,  we disagree on what a reasonable extrapolation from the data is .  I think there is what you would call confusion here .  I do think its just important to say this .  I have not criticized you ,  and I continue to not ,  for having the conversation .  Ive criticized you for having the conversation without dealing with and separating it out and thinking through the context and the weight of American history on it .  It cant possibly be irrelevant on something that even you admit is environmental! Let me ask you a question on this .  Let me try to think about how to phrase this question . You say that it is unfair ,  journalistically ,  to put your conversation within the lineage of the conversation going all the way back in American history and all the way ,  as you say ,  the pre-American history - in fact ,  in my piece ,  I quote Voltaire and Hume and others - that at each point European-descended white men of scientific mind looked around them ,  looked at the society they saw ,  looked at the outcomes people had in the society they saw ,  looked at the science pulled from those outcomes ,  right ?  And it was called science back then too .  And said ,  \"You know what ?  What we are seeing here is a result of innate differences between the races . \"Weve not even talked through questions of what it even means to talk about races and the way that has changed over time ,  but Ill just bracket that .  Its been justified in different ways with different kinds of science ,  but now we look back and we say ,  \"Oh man ,  they did not know what they were talking about .  That was ridiculous .  I mean ,  look at what was going on in their society . \" They looked and they ran their studies and they ran the numbers and they said ,  \"You know ,  theres just a difference here .  Theres a difference here and that is why things are turning out the way they are . \"Tell me why it is unfair to put your conversation in that lineage .  Why the burden of proof is not actually on you to say here is why it is different this time .  Here is why we are at a point ,  either in American history ,  or science ,  or whatever ,  where we are certain that nobody in 50 years is going to look back at us and say that .  Because scientifically what ,  the scientists who are on my side of this argument ,  think ,  and they include James Flynn and many others ,  they say thats where we are here .  I just quoted him to you .  Again ,  I just spoke to him two days ago .  James Flynn just said to me two days ago that it is consistent with the evidence that there is a genetic advantage or disadvantaged for African Americans .  That it is entirely possible that the 10-point IQ difference we see reflects a 12-point environmental difference and a negative-two genetic difference .  So ,  I think this is actually a good place ,  as you said ,  you mentioned end games .  I think this is a good place to get the end game ,  and Ill let this be my final comment . Something that you said in there as you can look at you and know youre not Korean .  This where you get into the question of race being a social category that does have ,  in some cases biological markers ,  but on which we are now overlaying early genetic science .  Its often not true ,  of course ,  for people who are African American ,  you can look at someone there ,  and maybe theyre actually from the Caribbean ,  or maybe theyre half-white ,  or maybe all kinds of things happen .  A hundred years ago ,  Im not white ,  now I am . You dont seem to see a lot of people saying ,  \"Hey ,  like ,  lets resuscitate the mid-20th century versions of white races . \" Instead ,  we group what we now think of as white people together .  And then there are Hispanics ,  which are another strangely constructed category ,  over here . And so in terms of how all this helps us have a more sophisticated discussion ,  a discussion that makes us more ready to absorb these findings as they come down the line ,  I actually dont really understand it and I dont think I ever have .  If you want to have discussions about very precise population categories ,  I think that we should come up with good language for doing that .  I think that if you read a lot of these studies ,  people do . That isnt what your conversation was about ,  and its not what the conversation in this country has generally been about .  Again ,  I think that if you read someone like Reich or talk to folks in this field ,  they are precise in a way that American politics often isnt . Look ,  you talked about the stakes of this conversation ,  and there are stakes to it .  Some of them are policy stakes .  Those are the ones Charles Murray is fundamentally interested in ,  ones that when you asked him why you should have this conversation he kept bringing up .  There are stakes in how we treat each other and what kind of groups we see in each other .  I think using these conversations to become more precise ,  as opposed to less precise - using these conversations to begin to question social categories that we build for political purposes in this country ,  as opposed to validate them in strange ways that dont have consistency across them - I think we could be doing a better job on that . In all this ,  what I would say ,  and Ill let this be my final point ,  and I appreciate the time youve given to this conversation today ,  is I think that to have this conversation well ,  to be ready for what may or may not come down the pike ,  to be able to talk about this ,  as you say ,  like adults ,  I think that you would be doing your audience a service to let go of some of the feelings you have about what you call identity politics and what you see in others with identity politics and have more conversations about race in America and the way it is built and they way it is seen and the way it acts on peoples life chances . I think that there is room to have conversations about genetic findings ,  but because we are mapping those conversations onto social-political realities ,  having more conversations where you deliver more nuance and more understanding ,  where you yourself get more understanding of the social-political realities - I feel uncomfortable being the person on the other side of the chair here .  I dont think - Im not an expert on race and IQ - but Im also not someone who I think is the right spokesperson for the experience of other races in this country .  And I dont think that is me falling into a trap of identity politics .  I think that is me being honest about what are the limits of my own perception .  Theres a lot I can learn ,  but ,  you know ,  Im a political journalist and Ive only learned so much . I continue to think that the way you handled the conversation with Murray ,  framing it as a question of political correctness ,  did too much to ignore what this conversation has meant to people ,  for whom the dangers is not that Charles Murray will be - and I think this was bad - be de-platformed and even have his chaperone assaulted at Middlebury ,  or what has been more normal in his career ,  be extremely successful but widely criticized .  I think that a conversation with a broader range of experts would give you more texture and more empathy for the people whom this conversation and its imprecision and the way it gets leveraged in American life really hurts them . Ill end by noting what you said about Andrew Sullivan .  Andrew is a friend of mine .  I do not think hes a racist ,  and I take his honesty seriously ,  and I appreciate the conversations he wants to have .  I think that was one of the more misguided pieces Ive seen .  The fundamental argument of that piece was that in order to have a better conversation about race ,  we need to have a conversation about Murrayism .  We need to have a conversation that front-loads the idea that there are intrinsic differences between these groups and that will somehow heal our racial conversation . What I would say to you ,  what I would say to him ,  is our history as a country shows the exact precise opposite ,  that at- That is what Andrew said ,  and you brought up Andrews piece ,  so Im just noting that .  Let me hold our conversation for one second ,  and Ill just call up the headline piece of you dont mind .  The headline of Andrews piece is ,  \"Denying genetics isnt shutting down racism ,  its fueling it . \" I think that if you read that piece ,  that is exactly what that piece does .  Heres the key of what Andrew says in the piece ,  and Ill just quote it .  \"At the same time if we assume genetics plays no role\" - hes talking here about intelligence - \"and base our policy prescriptions on something untrue\" - so now hes saying that were pretty sure genetics does play a role in group intelligence differences .  \"We are likely to overshoot and overpromise in social policy and see our rhetoric on race become ever more extreme and divisive .  We may even embrace racial discrimination as an affirmative action that fuels deeper divides . \"What I keep seeing in this conversation is white conservative men who want to say that we are at a point where we can say with reasonable confidence that there are intrinsic intellectual differences between the groups that are at least partly genetic ,  that that is a reason to look at the racial inequalities in American society and say ,  \"Hey look ,  that is not just a consequence of our history .  That is just something that is innate to us an we should not be overreaching . \" Youre right ,  thats fair enough .  Thats a totally fair point .  I would criticize you for not calling it out more ,  but you are right ,  you have not said that .  But Ive been careful on who Im saying Im hearing that from .  That will somehow lead to a better conversation .  I think a conversation that included more African-American voices and more people who have specialization in the history of race in America ,  in the history of these ideas in America ,  in the history of how these ideas and social policy in America interact ,  would lead to a better ,  more fruitful ,  more ,  as you put it ,  adult ,  and also a more constructive ,  debate .  I apologize ,  I didnt respond to that ,  youre right .  Let me give you my quick response on that . Youve said a couple of times that there are scientists in your inbox who refuse to be named ,  but who agree with you ,  and that theres a link to one of the Vox pieces on ,  was it the Southern Poverty Law Centers hate site ?  Was that who it was ?  The reason Ive not focused on this ,  as you know ,  its something you say in your conversation with Murray ,  there are tons and tons of unbelievably serious racists who find a lot of succor in Murrayism .  Im not grouping you with them ,  but they love what he says .  You say yourself ,  \"Im sure all these hate supremacist groups are ecstatic about The Bell Curve ,  why should we even be talking about it ? \"The reason Ive not really responded to that is Im here to defend what I think and to talk about the piece we published at Vox .  Im not going to make you answer for everyone who you did not have on your show ,  but who has a more sinister view than the person you did have on your show .  I think that in this conversation ,  there are a lot of folks who take it in directions I wouldnt .  I think thats true basically in every political conversation Ive ever seen and been part of .  Whenever I open my Twitter feed ,  which lately Im not doing ,  because Im on book leave ,  mentions are always ,  if you go into them a shit show ,  which is why I dont do it anymore .  I just dont find that that compelling . I think that we are having a debate .  I dont think anybody has been silenced or de-platformed .  From the beginning ,  Ive been willing to have this discussion with you in public and put it out on Vox and put it out on your side as well .  I think a lot of what we just have had from the beginning here is a debate .  Its a debate that you felt has been in bad faith and been done by people on our side who dont have integrity ,  but obviously that is not my view . This is just how this goes .  Charles Murray still has a great job and makes a ton of money and goes on speaking tours and all the rest of it .  You have a popular podcast with 9 , 000 Patreon supporters .  I am an editor at Vox .  I just dont think that we are the losers in this . I think youre very sensitive to the possible cost of a backlash framed around what you would call political correctness and a lot less sensitive - which is what I keep coming back to - to the cost this idea has actually had for African Americans in this country throughout American history .  And the cost ,  by the way ,  that Charles Murray wants it to have .  What is the analogy youre drawing exactly here ?  Im sorry ,  I want to make sure I understand this here .  Are you comparing the idea that there are not Jews in the finals of the New York City or Boston Marathon or whatever ,  to the conversation about whether African Americans ,  after what has gone on in this countrys history ,  are scoring worse in IQ ?  I want to make sure Im understanding what youre saying .  You call it politically correct ,  but youre bringing it up in this conversation .  I didnt make you do this ,  just as Ive not made you talk about race and IQ .  I do think this is a good place to close ,  because I do think this is our bedrock disagreement .  I think you look at me ,  you look at the folks who you see as engaging in identity politics ,  which is something other people do ,  but not you ,  and you see tribalism . You see on my part a social justice warrior tribalism of some sort or another ,  someone who is looking for evidence of racism and bigotry .  I look at our society ,  and I see society that ,  even now ,  on every study we run ,  shows huge ,  huge ,  huge racial bias .  I mean ,  I look at a study done just a couple of years ago ,  showing that if you send employers a resume and everything is equal except for the name ,  one name is African American-coded and another name is European-coded ,  you get 50 percent fewer callbacks [for] the African-Americans . I look at evidence of it ,  when African-Americans go into the hospital ,  they do not get treatment for pain at the same rates as white Americans ,  because doctors do not believe them .  They think theyre trying to scam the drugs or something . I see us a society that is not 100 years or 1 , 000 years or 10 , 000 years away from a long ,  long ,  long legacy of not just racism ,  but violence and oppression of the worst kind ,  a society where we did things that even now to just go through them ,  it chills you .  But that was 50 years ago .  Some of it still goes on today . I look at that and I say ,  a society like that ,  where youre having these conversations between white men ,  where the implication of these conversations is that the white majority is going to have to give up a lot more to bring about the equality that we like to believe that America is committed to ,  that is going to enact a profound tribalism on that majority . It doesnt mean theres not tribalism among the minorities ,  or anyone else ,  but its going to enact a profound tribalism on the majority .  When Charles Murray is asked why hes talking about this and he says ,  \"Because I dont like affirmative action . \" When Andrew Sullivan ,  in the segment I just gave you ,  says why should we talk about this ?  He says ,  because I dont like affirmative action ,  it might make everything worse ?  Yeah ,  thats the society I see .  It doesnt mean I couldnt be talked out of it .  It doesnt mean if we get evidence in 25 or 50 years of genetic discoveries we have not had yet ,  that I couldnt change my view . But right now ,  when I look at that evidence - and Ill tell you ,  Sam ,  like I do so with integrity and trying to think through the right answer just as I imagine you do ,  whatever you believe about me - I just put my understanding of where the blind spots are likely be differently than you do .  I think thats where to leave it .  I think that is fundamentally our dividing line .  You look at people in this debate and you say ,  \"Theyre looking for examples of racism .  They dont want to believe this other stuff .  Its just science . \"I look at that and I say ,  its not actually .  The science is not showing that yet .  We have a society that is still ,  that is way ,  way ,  way ,  way far away from where it should be .  I dont know .  I see this differently than you do .  You have that bewildering experience because you dont realize when you keep saying that everybody else is thinking tribally ,  but youre not ,  that that is our disagreement .  Well ,  that is our disagreement .  I dont think it would be a relief to you at all .  Because the thing that you said when you ,  I feel like now were just getting back to the beginning and we should let this go and Ill let you get the last word after this ,  but right at the beginning of all this with Murray you said ,  you look at Murray and you see what happens to you .  You were completely straightforward about that ,  that you look at what happens to him and you see what happens to you .  I think the really .  We all have a lot of different identities were part of all times .  I do ,  too .  I have all kinds of identities that you can call forward .  All of them can bias me simultaneous ,  and the questions ,  of course ,  are which dominate and how am I able to counterbalance them through my process of information gathering and adjudication of that information .  I think that your core identity in this is as someone who feels you get treated unfairly by politically correct mobs and - That is what folks from the dominant group get to do .  They get to say ,  my thing isnt identity politics ,  only yours is .  I will tell you ,  Sam ,  when people who do not look like you hear you telling them that this is just identity politics ,  they dont think ,  \"God hes right .  That is just identity politics . \" They think this is my experience and you dont understand it .  You just said its your experience and they dont understand it .  I think that you have said publicly that you would not have a conversation with Ta-Nehisi Coates ,  because you think he just plays identity politics .  I think thats a good place for us both to end . \n",
